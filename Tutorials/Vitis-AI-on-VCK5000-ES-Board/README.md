# Introduction

Vitis AI, understood as the Xilinxâ€™s development stack for AI inference on unified Xilinx hardware platforms has minimize the differentiation for model deployment flow on Versal devices. This tutorial will start from card installation and go through the workflow step by step to run the first Vitis AI sample on **VCK5000 ES card**. If you are using a **VCK5000 prod cards**. Please visit the [vck5000 lounge](https://www.xilinx.com/member/vck5000-aie.html#vitis-ai) .

Generally speaking, users can easily get the inference work on VCK5000 with following three steps.

 + Setup the host environments with the scripts Xilinx has provided.
 + Enter the docker environment to enable Vitis AI tools.
 + Inference on board with the pre-compiled models.  

# Inplementation

This section will lead you through the steps necessary to complete the setup.
.
## Prerequisites

 + An x86 host machine with that meets the [sytem requirements](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI/blob/master/doc/system_requirements.md) and internet access to download files.
 + Host machine with Xilinx design tools pre-installed (No earlier than version 2021.1).
 
## Step 1 - Set up the host

Xilinx has provided some scripts to help to automatically finish the Alveo card setup process which user could refer to and understand the required steps.

First of all, please make sure the card has been placed proerly and securely in your server or workstation. For detailed info, please refer to the VCK5000 installation guide [UG1531](https://www.xilinx.com/content/dam/xilinx/member/vck5000-aie/ug1531-vck5000_WtMkX.pdf).

Please run the ***lspci*** command to check that the VCK5000 Card has been installed.

```shell
$ lspci -vd 10ee:
```

An output similar to the following example is seen. 

```
02:00.0 Processing accelerators: Xilinx Corporation Device 5044

        Subsystem: Xilinx Corporation Device 000e

        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 16, NUMA node 0

        Memory at 380030000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=128M]

        Memory at 380038020000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=128K]

        Capabilities: <access denied>

        Kernel driver in use: xclmgmt

        Kernel modules: xclmgmt

02:00.1 Processing accelerators: Xilinx Corporation Device 5045

        Subsystem: Xilinx Corporation Device 000e

        Capabilities: <access denied>

        Kernel driver in use: xocl

        Kernel modules: xocl
```

Then, clone the Vitis-AI repository from Github and enter the vck5000 folder to start the AI journey on VCK5000.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI.git -b 1.4
$ cd <path_to_Vitis-AI>/setup/vck5000
```

```bash

```

After download the platform, please extract the file and install them in the following order.

***Noted:*** The command in following section is writen based on the Ubuntu 18.04 system.

```bash
$ tar -xzvf xilinx-vck5000-es1-gen3x16-platform-2-1_all.deb.tar.gz
$ sudo apt install xilinx-sc-fw-vck5000_4.4.6-2.e1f5e26_all.deb
$ sudo apt install xilinx-vck5000-es1-gen3x16-validate_2-3123623_all.deb
$ sudo apt install xilinx-vck5000-es1-gen3x16-base_2-3123623_all.deb
```

After installation, user can use the following command to check if the platform has been installed properply. The ***xbmgmt*** is the platform manangement tools which is integreted with XRT. The ***sudo roles*** is required to execute the command.

```bash
$ sudo /opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xbmgmt flash --scan
```

An output similar to the following example is seen which shows the platform currently running on the VCK5000 card with all the platforms have been installed.

```bash

***Noted:*** Cold reboot is compulsury to let the new platform take effect.

## Step 3 - Enable Docker environment

Vitis AI tools has been released in the format of Docker container to avoid the libraries mismatch among different OS versions. Please all the users refer to [official Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install the docker. Then start the docker container with the following command.

```bash
$ cd <path_to_Vitis-AI>
$ ./docker_run.sh xilinx/vitis-ai-cpu:1.4.916
```

The docker container will start and you should see something like this in the terminal:


```bash
==========================================

__      ___ _   _                   _____
\ \    / (_) | (_)            /\   |_   _|
 \ \  / / _| |_ _ ___ ______ /  \    | |
  \ \/ / | | __| / __|______/ /\ \   | |
   \  /  | | |_| \__ \     / ____ \ _| |_
    \/   |_|\__|_|___/    /_/    \_\_____|

==========================================

Docker Image Version:  1.4.916
Build Date: 2021-07-20
VAI_ROOT: /opt/vitis_ai

For TensorFlow 1.15 Workflows do:
     conda activate vitis-ai-tensorflow 
For Caffe Workflows do:
     conda activate vitis-ai-caffe 
For PyTorch Workflows do:
     conda activate vitis-ai-pytorch 
For TensorFlow 2.3 Workflows do:
     conda activate vitis-ai-tensorflow2 
Vitis-AI /workspace > 
```

Then, you can use the following command to set environment variables. It should be noted that the xclbin file should be in the /opt/xilinx/overlaybins directory.

```bash
$ cd /workspace/setup/vck5000
$ source ./setup.sh
```

## Step 4 - Inference with pre-compiled model
In this section, it will demonstrate the inference progress with pre-compiled models. Users who is using customized model or want to attempt the quantization and compilation workflow can refer to another [Vitis-AI tutorial](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI-Tutorials/tree/master/Introduction/03-Basic/Module_5) 

1) Download the pre-compiled model from model zoo
  For each model, there will be a yaml file which is used for describe all the details about the model. 
	In the yaml, you will find the model's download links for different platforms. Please choose the corresponding model and download it. Click [Xilinx AI Model Zoo](../../models/AI-Model-Zoo/model-list) to view all the models. For VCK5000 card. Please download the model with DPUCVDX8H, taking `Enet` as an example here.

	* Download the model according to the model's yaml file.
	```
	$ wget https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=ENet_cityscapes_pt-vck5000-DPUCVDX8H-r1.4.0.tar.gz -O ENet_cityscapes_pt-vck5000-DPUCVDX8H-r1.4.0.tar.gz
	```

	* Install the model package.  
	If the `/usr/share/vitis_ai_library/models` folder does not exist, create it first.
	```
	  $ sudo mkdir /usr/share/vitis_ai_library/models
	  $ tar -xzvf ENet_cityscapes_pt-vck5000-DPUCVDX8H-r1.4.0.tar.gz
	  $ sudo cp ENet_cityscapes_pt /usr/share/vitis_ai_library/models -r
	```	

**Note that different alveo cards correspond to different model files, which cannot be used alternately.** 

2) Prepare the images or videos for inference

   Download the image and video packages and untar them with the following commands.
  
```
cd /workspace
$ wget https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=vitis_ai_library_r1.4.0_images.tar.gz -O vitis_ai_library_r1.4.0_images.tar.gz
$ wget https://www.xilinx.com/bin/public/openDownload?filename=vitis_ai_library_r1.4.0_video.tar.gz -O vitis_ai_library_r1.4.0_video.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf vitis_ai_library_r1.4.0_images.tar.gz -C demo/Vitis-AI-Library/
$ tar -xzvf vitis_ai_library_r1.4.0_video.tar.gz -C demo/Vitis-AI-Library/
```

3) Compile and inference

Please compile the example and run the inference with the following image.

  <img width="512" height="256" src="images/sample_segmentation.png">
  </p>

```
$ cd /workspace/demo/Vitis-AI-Library/samples/segmentation
$ bash -x build.sh
$ ./test_jpeg_segmentation ENet_cityscapes_pt sample_segmentation.jpg
```

The output file will be generated as below.
